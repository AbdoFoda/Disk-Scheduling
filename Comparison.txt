The difference of performance in such algorithms:
The Fist come first served algorithm is the worst among them.
because it depends on the sequence of the arriving disk-access requests,
which is unknown of course to the algorithm, in brief sequence of requests  :
1-	Increasing or decreasing : better performance
2-	Randomized : bad performance

The Shortest seek time algorithm can be considered to be the best in the case,
of the randomization of the requests because it picks the shortest ( closer )
seeking time in each disk-access
